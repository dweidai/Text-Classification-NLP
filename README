To run my files is actually pretty easy if you have jupyter notebook.
1. Download the datasets and put all files along with the .ipynb files
   into the same folder
2. Open jupyter notebook and upload the folder to the desired location
   of your own
3. To run the supervised learning one, please open Supervised.ipynb in
   the sup folder
4. Then run through all the blocks
5. To run the semi-supervised learning one, please open 
    Semi-supervised.ipynb in the semisup folder.
6. Then run through all the blocks
7. If you do not have jupyter notebook installed, you
   may try to run each sentiment file because it
   has built-in main functions; however, there is no guarantee
   that it will compile or run accordingly. If you have trouble debugging
   please download jupyter notebook.
